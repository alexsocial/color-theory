This project is part of a seven project plan I hopefully will finish within due time.  

# Project 1/7: The Color Theory Tester/Creator  
## Language: Java  
### Start Date: 11-Jan-24  

Description: The user provides two HEX colors. The goal of the program is to see if it fulfills a matching color theory (i.e. dark blue working with light blue) or whether colors do NOT work with each other, if so explain which one. It will also allow the user to create 5-8 color palletes with designated colors and names to that palette.
